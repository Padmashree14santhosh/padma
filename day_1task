1.	Write a blog on Difference between HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP2.

•	HTTP/1.1  loads the information from the server one after the other, if one resource is missing then it will block other resource until missing resource arrived at the client browser. 
But HTTP2 follows multiplexing , it means it sends the multiple streams of data at once, so no one resource blocks any other resource.
•	HTTP/1.1 sends the data to the client browser when client browser sends the request to it.  But HTTP2 allows a server to push content to a client before client asks for it. Server predicts that what client request will be.
•	HTTP/1.1 load the information slower than HTTP2. HTTP2 uses the advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates the redundant information in HTTP header packets, so this will eliminate a few bytes from every HTTP packet. So, some volume in HTTP packet will get involved in the loading which will result in faster loading.


2.	Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in JavaScript.

•	Object in JavaScript is like a variable. It is a collection of named values that having state(properties) and behavior(method).
•	Syntax: let <object_name>={    key 1:value 1,
                                 Key 2: value:2,…key N:value N, };
•	The key: value pairs in JavaScript object called properties.
•	JavaScript object is mutable, it means the properties in the object can be changed, added and delete.
•	Syntax for adding: Object_name.objectproperty=propertyValue
•	Syntax for deleting delete object_name.objectproperty
•	Syntax for access a property: object_name.property.
